						<h5>About me</h5>
						<hr />
						<p>
							I am a rising senior Computer Science at UMass Amherst currently looking
							for internships and any other entry-level job opportunities.
						</p>
						<p>
							I am interested in backend/fullstack, security, and machine learning. I
							do not have much working experience in these fields but I am a fast
							learner and a hard worker. I would love to have the opportunities to
							learn and grow.
						</p>
						<p>
							I wrote my first Hello World program when I was 15 when I was exploring
							my career options. I was so fascinated by what the computer is capable
							of when I dived deeper into programming. Since then, my only goal was to
							become a software developer. That is why I am pursuing Computer Science
							as my Major.
